        <b>The internet</b> is a vast <b> global network</b> of interconnected computer networks that communicate with
        each other using <em> standardized communication protocols.</em> It enables users to access a variety of digital
        resources

        A <b> web server</b> is a computer system or software that responds to requests from client computers over the
        internet or a local network, delivering web pages and other content to users. It hosts and serves web pages,
        files, images, videos, and other digital content using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure
        counterpart, HTTPS. The web server software, such as Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS, listens on a specific port
        for incoming requests and processes them by retrieving the requested content from the server's file system or
        database, generating dynamic content on the fly, or forwarding the request to another web server or application
        server. Web servers can also handle authentication, caching, load balancing, and other tasks to ensure fast,
        secure, and reliable delivery of web content.
