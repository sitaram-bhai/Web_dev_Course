    <h4><q>Core Internet Technology</q></h4>
    <p>
        An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the
        internet. IP addresses are used to identify and communicate with devices on the internet, just like phone
        numbers are used to identify and communicate with people on a phone network.

        There are two versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 and IPv6. <br>

        IP addresses are essential for routing data packets between devices on the internet. When a device sends a
        request to another device on the internet, it uses the destination device's IP address to route the data packet
        to the correct destination.

        IP addresses can be assigned dynamically or statically. Dynamic IP addresses are assigned automatically by a
        DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server, while static IP addresses are manually assigned to a device
        and do not change unless manually reconfigured.

        In summary, IP addresses are unique numerical identifiers that are essential for communication and data transfer
        on the internet.

    <h4>Data transmission</h4>
    Data transmission refers to the process of sending digital data over a communication channel or network from one
    device to another. Here are the basic steps involved in data transmission:

    <li>Encoding: The digital data is converted into a format that can be transmitted over the communication channel,
        such
        as binary or hexadecimal.</li>

    <li>Transmission: The encoded data is transmitted over the communication channel, which can be a wired or wireless
        connection.</li>

    <li>Reception: The receiving device receives the transmitted data.</li>

    <li>Decoding: The received data is decoded back into its original format, such as text or an image.</li>

    <p> Data transmission can occur over various types of communication channels, such as copper wires, fiber optic
        cables,
        or wireless radio waves. The speed and quality of data transmission depend on several factors, such as the
        bandwidth
        of the communication channel, the distance between the transmitting and receiving devices, and the level of
        interference in the communication channel. Different protocols, such as TCP/IP, are used to manage the
        transmission
        of data over networks and ensure that the data is delivered reliably and efficiently.

        An HTTP requests consists of a method, path, version and headers. The HTTP method describes the type of action
        that the client must performed. The primary or the most commonly used HTTP methods are, GET, POST, PUT, and
        DELETE.

        <li>Successful: 200 to 299 </li>
        <li>Redirection: 300 to 399</li>
        <li>Client error: 400 to 499</li>
        <li>Server error: 500 to 599</li>

        HTTP Request Headers
    <pre>
            Host: example.com
            User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS <br> X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
            Accept: */*
            Accept-Language: en
            Content-type: text/json
        </pre>
 <p>
            The Host header specifies the host of the server and indicates where the resource is requested from.
            The User-Agent header informs the web server of the application that is making the request. It often <br> includes the operating system <br> (Windows, Mac, Linux), version and application vendor.
            The Accept header informs the web server what type of content the client will accept as the response.
            The Accept-Language header indicates the language and optionally the locale that the client prefers.
            The Content-type header indicates the type of content being transmitted in the request body.

    <h3 id="valum">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h3>
    <p> When your computer connects to a network, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP as it is commonly
        known,
        is used to assign your computer an IP address.
        Your computer communicates over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) using the protocol with a type of server called a
        DHCP
        server.
